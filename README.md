This a program I and my friend created for the national IT Olympiad back in 2010 under the supervision
of our IT teacher. We were 11-th graders in high school back then and this is my first bigger project. 
I did the coding and my friend did the graphical design. We managed to get to the final phase of the 
Olympiad with this program and scored 61.33 points out of 100 for it.

*Note:* The UI and all the text shown while running the program is in Bulgarian. This was a requirement.
However the source code(class names, variable names, comments, etc) is in English(with a small exceptions 
that you could figure out from the context). The installer is also in English.

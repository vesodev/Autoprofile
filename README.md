# Autoprofile
This a program I and my friend created for the national IT Olympiad back in 2010 under the supervision
of our IT teacher. We were 11-th graders in high school back then and this is my first bigger project. 
I did the coding and my friend did the graphical design. We managed to get to the final phase of the 
Olympiad with this program and scored 61.33 points out of 100 for it.

**Note:** The UI and all the text shown while running the program is in Bulgarian. This was a requirement.
However the source code(class names, variable names, comments, etc) is in English(with small exceptions 
that you could figure out from the context). The installer is also in English.

## Requirements
To build the main program and/or the installer:
* Visual Studio 2008 or newer(versions newer that 2010 weren't tested but will probably work)
* .NET 3.5 or newer

**Note:** You can use the installer `Autoprofile Setup/Release/setup.exe` to install the program and try it out. 
The installer will offer you to download and install all the missing dependencies for you.

**Note:** This program was tested on Windows 7 and Windows XP SP2. It may work on newer versions of Windows 
but wont work on Linux or MacOs X because it uses some of the Win32 API as well.

## How to use it?
If you read Bulgarian then launch the program and click the button with the `?` in buttom side of the window. 
In the window that pops up you can read the short tutorial.

Otherwise this program won't be of much use to you.
